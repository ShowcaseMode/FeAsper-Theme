<h1> FeAsper-Theme </h1>
A resource pack that I made using some other packs as well as adding and modifying a lot of it myself.

<h3> How to edit this pack </h3>
<h4> STEP (1): </h4> Finding... the packs on Runelite are located in this path ( C:\Users\Micro\.runelite\resource-packs-repository )
<br></br>
<b> EXCEPTIONS 1... </b> the ( C: ) is called a drive yours might look like this ( D: ) ( E:) ( F:) etc...
<br></br>
<b> EXCEPTIONS 2... </b> the (Micro) is called your PC username so it will be your name most likely...

<h4> STEP (2): </h4> Moving... you will need to move the folder to somewhere safe and secure for example ( C:\Users\Micro\Documents\pack-FeAsper-Theme )
<br></br>
<b> ADDITIONAL 1... </b> How do I move it? The best way is to click on the folder and press on keyboard [Ctrl + x] then go to where you want the file to be located and press on the keyboard [Ctrl + v]
